There is no official entry for Meetups, so here is how to inform your contributions:

# You are a Meetup Organizer

On every meetup, add a [Conference Organizer](conference-organizer.md) entry, informing the contribution area, number of attendees, etc. of that specific meeting. If you are also the speaker, add an extra entry as described below.

# You are speaking at a specific Meetup

Add a regular [Speaking - User Group](speaking.md) entry for that specific meeting.

# You are the Organizer of a recurrent Meetup/User group

If your Meetup has members and the meetings happen periodically, add an extra entry close to the end of the year's cycle (currently in March) informing the General Contribution Area, total number of members and the number of meetings that cycle had.

Ex: you are a Meet Organizer, had 10 meetings that cycle and spoke on 3 of them. You should add:
  - 10 entries as [Conference Organizer](conference-organizer.md) (use number of attendees)
  - 3 entries as [Speaking - User Group](speaking.md) (use number of attendees)
  - 1 entry as [User Group Owner](user-group-owner.md) (use number of members)
