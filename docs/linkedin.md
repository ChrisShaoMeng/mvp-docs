We are all very proud to be awared with the Microsoft MVP Award and one of the first places one would want to share the news is on LinkedIn.

# Where should I add my new/renewed MVP Award?

The best place to add your MVP Award is in the `Accomplishments -> Honors & Awards` section. You can also add this information in your profile's `Summary` section.

## Dont's:

### You should not add your MVP Award in your profile's `Headline`

That could confuse people that you work for Microsoft, which is not the case.

### You should not add your MVP Award in the `Experience` section of your profile

That could confuse people that you work for Microsoft, which is not the case. Remeber that this is not a work experience, it is an award given by Microsoft to you.
