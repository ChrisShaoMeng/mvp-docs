# Unofficial MVP Contribution Guide

Every year we have new awesome MVPs receiving the MVP Award. Reporting our community activities always was a source of confusion and a recurring subject in our meetings. Even veterans with 10+ years as MVPs sometimes don't agree about how to report a specific contribution, so we are creating this central point of information.

## This is not official

We can't repeat ourselves enough when we said this is not official. **Always ask your MVP Lead before using any information from here**. And please, if he/she disagrees, ask him/her to send us a pull-request!

# Contributing

## Translations

For a new language, create a folder with the desired language tag in the `docs` folder.

Ex: 
  - /docs -> English (default)
  - /docs/pt -> Portuguese

You can change the current language in the upper right translations dropdown.

## Fallback

The English files are the default ones. If you choose another language and there is an equal filename on the `/docs/[your language]` folder, this translated file will be shown instead.
