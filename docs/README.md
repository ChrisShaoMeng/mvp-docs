# Unofficial MVP Contribution Guide

Every year we have new awesome MVPs receiving the MVP Award. Reporting our community activities always was a source of confusion and a recurring subject in our meetings. Even veterans with 10+ years as MVPs sometimes don't agree about how to report a specific contribution, so we are creating this central point of information.

## This is not official

We can't repeat ourselves enough when we said this is not official. **Always ask your MVP Lead before using any information from here**. And please, if he/she disagrees, ask him/her to send us a pull-request!
