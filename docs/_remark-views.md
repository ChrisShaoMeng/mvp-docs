## Views from one year to another

Some items like posts, articles, videos and others are more like "ongoing contributions". You put it there on the Internet and people will access it for a long time.

So what if you make a contribution like that very close to the end of the cycle? It would have very few views, but that number would grow as the year goes by.

### Things to do:

That's trick and there is not much agreement on what you should or shouldn't do, but here are some ideas:

#### Update the contribution's views number at the end of the cycle

You should do that always, as it would reflect the last state of the contribution for that cycle.

#### Update the contribution and submit it again the next cycle

Take some time to revisit your contribution and add new information to it. Update old links or documentation and submit it again as a new one the next cycle. Make sure to inform only the difference in views between your last submission and this new one.

#### What about videos that are hard to update?

If you think your video had a substantial increase in views after the submission date, add it again informing the increasement in views and explain your rational in the description section.

#### Use de Description Section

In case of doubt, write your rational into the description section. Remember that the people reading your contributions are really nice and reasonable.
